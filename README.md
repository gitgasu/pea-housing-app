# People Empowering App (PEA) - HCI Design Project

Empowering NYC Residents to Navigate Housing Insecurity

## Project Overview

The People Empowering App (PEA) is a mobile-first application designed to help New York City residents navigate housing insecurity through:
- Step-by-step guidance through complex processes
- 24/7 access to human support
- Proactive, personalized suggestions
- Connection to no-fee listings and voucher-accepting landlords
- Transparency about costs, rights, and options

## Research Foundation

- **Personas**: 3 distinct user segments
- **Feature Validation**: 100% for core features

## Design Deliverables

- [Concise Presentation](pea_concise_presentation.html) - Condensed 10-slide overview

### Documentation
- [User Flows](user_flows.md) - Visual journey maps for all personas
- [User Testing Plan](user_testing_plan.html) - Comprehensive testing protocol

## User Personas

### Mr. L - Emergency Housing Seeker
**Quote**: "Don't make me more confused than I already am."
- Age: 45-55 | Tech Comfort: Low
- Needs extreme simplicity, clear next steps, human guidance

### Ms. Ellis - Voucher Holder
**Quote**: "I have a Section 8 voucher, but landlords won't even show me apartments."
- Age: 35-45 | Tech Comfort: Medium
- Needs voucher-accepting landlords, rights information, engagement strategies

### Mr. Patterson - Cost-Conscious Renter
**Quote**: "Broker fees are 15% of annual rent. That's thousands of dollars I don't have."
- Age: 25-35 | Tech Comfort: High
- Needs no-fee listings, cost transparency, savings calculators

## Design Principles

1. **Trauma-Informed**: Respectful of vulnerable populations experiencing crisis
2. **User-Centered**: Every design decision validated by research findings
3. **Accessible**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, plain language, mobile-first
4. **Empowering**: Builds confidence through clarity and human connection
5. **Radical Simplicity**: Reduce cognitive load, don't add to it
6. **Human-Centered Technology**: Technology supports, humans empower

## MVP Features (Phase 1)

1. **Personalized Action Plans** - Step-by-step guidance tailored to user situation
2. **24/7 Human Support Hub** - Live chat, phone, video, SMS channels
3. **Smart Suggestions Engine** - AI-powered proactive recommendations
4. **Housing Search & Filter** - No-fee and voucher-accepting filters prominent

## Technology Stack (Proposed)

- **Frontend**: React Native (mobile-first)
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Design**: Figma prototypes → HTML/CSS mockups
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliant

## Project Status

✅ Research & Analysis Complete
✅ User Personas Validated
✅ Wireframes Complete (12 screens)
✅ Interactive Prototype Built
✅ Design System Documented
✅ User Testing Plan Ready
⏳ Next: User Testing (6-15 participants)
⏳ Future: High-Fidelity Mockups
⏳ Future: MVP Development

## Key Research Findings

- **100%** core feature validation (action plans, human support, proactive suggestions)
- **100%** of users have smartphones (mobile-first is non-negotiable)
- **80%** prefer mobile apps over desktop
- **60%** have limited computer access
- **Critical pain points**: Information overload, landlord discrimination, broker fees (15% annual rent), lack of human support

## Success Metrics

- Task Completion: ≥80%
- Time on Task: ≤10 minutes per flow
- Confusion Rate: ≤20%
- SUS Score: ≥70
- Critical: Mr. L types never say "I'm confused"

## Expected Impact

- **$3,600** average savings per user (no broker fees)
- **24/7** human support access
- **100%** mobile accessible
- **Reduced** landlord discrimination through transparency
